Find correlationship between "Acousticness Score" and "Streaming Success". In other words, Our project team figured out that Acousticness would be key factor of success for Spotify Straeming.

Our team concluded that "Scatter Chart" woud be the most effective to get correlation between "Acousticness Score" and "Streaming Success", so we followed the steps below.

* **Build up** : From the original data (exported from Kaggle), we extract only necessary data for this topic. (Score of Acousticness, Total number of Stream).
* **Refine** : Sort out the data for plotting scatter chart. First, we refine the data format for accuracy. Second, we define the values for chart, linear regression.
* **Finalize** : We created the scatter chart for this correlationship. Additionally, we found the point for correlations is **0.01**.


  
**[Result]**

Our team strongly believed that Acousticness would be important for streaming success.

Unexpectedly, the result was that correlationship between them are so weak. 

Finally, **we concluded that Acousticness is not key value for streaming success**.

Therefore, the musicians can make their music style as they want. Instead, It'd better to focus on other factors like released date.
